# Real-Time-Air-Quality-Monitoring-System-Using-Arduino-
Built a sensor-based system to monitor air quality and display results in real time. Learned how to test system  outputs, interpret data, and explain results clearly to users. This project improved my understanding of  product usage and troubleshooting.
